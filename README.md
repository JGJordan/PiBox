# 🚗 Driving Companion Project – IoT Project

**Student Name:** James Grogan  
**Student ID:** 20106285  

## 📌 Project Description
The **Driving Companion Project** is a rudimentary **BlackBox** system with additional safety features designed to track driving performance and enhance driver awareness. 

### 🔍 Features
- **Speed Monitoring:** Tracks if a driver exceeds the speed limit.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring:** Alerts the driver if the car temperature becomes too hot or humid, reducing the risk of drowsiness.
- **Emergency Detection:** Uses a motion sensor to detect harsh braking, emergency stops, and potential speeding events.

Despite the physics complexities involved, this project is within scope and feasible.
